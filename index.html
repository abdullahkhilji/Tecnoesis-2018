		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			From the WALL-Es to the Terminators to Sophia, robots have instilled fascination in us all at one point of our life or the other. Sumo Wars gives you the opportunity to live out your fascination and devise your own fully functional autonomous bots.<br>

			Sumo fight is an ancient form of art practiced in eastern countries for centuries as a sport. It involves a combat between the contestants in which they try to overthrow the opponent out of arena. SUMO WARS is inspired by the same,with the exception that bots try to overrun the other bots using their swiftness and robustness. You will be needed to build your own autonomous bots and cement your name as the king of the ring.
		</p><br>
		<h3>Problem statement:</h3>
		<p>In this autonomous robotic event, the competing team has to make a bot capable of searching and pushing opponent bot out of the arena, all the  whilekeeping itself inside the arena.</p><br>

		<h1>5.ROBOBUILD</h1>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>Has the game Lego been a deeply etched childhood memory of yours?<br><br>

			If the answer to the former questions are yes, then fellas! You’ve stepped your bot in the right arena. This tecnoesis we bring to you, an event which gives you an arena to both, construct and destruct at the same time. We give your motor skills a real challenge as the bots are fully mechanized and the control tactics are in your hands.<br><br>

			It's not only the race with time, but also a race with your opponent to see who has smartness with strength. Burn the arena with action to see who builds the best bot to build the best tower with the timer saying tick tock tick tock......<br><br>

			"Build your bot, it will build for you".
		</p><br>
		<h3>Problem statement:</h3>
		<p>
			Your team has to build two bots (assistive and builder namely) where one constructs and the other helps you collect blocks, defend your tower, and attack the opponent’s tower to bring ’em down.<br>
			Now as your bot is restricted to enter the opponent’s boundary, you will have to add a weapon on top of your assistive bot to bring the tower down.  Also, the mighty sphere is a cherry over the cake with a nostalgic tinge to Harry potter’s famous game Quidditch. To know more about the game, click on the Description given below.

			If yes then Roboarts is here for you - The Art Of Making Robots.
		</p><br>
		<h3>Problem statement:</h3>
		<p>
			The participants will be given 8 hours (4+4) to construct a bot. The bot application is unbounded, so 
			participants are free to use their imagination and may build any kind of bot. The bot will be judged 
			on the basis of its application, not complexity since it is a time bound event.

				<h1>1. DRAFT RITZ</h1>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>
					Designing plays an essential role in innovation. The field of designing accounts for majority of private research and development spending and employs a significant percentage of engineers. In order for society to benefit from the latest advances in technology, skilled engineers and novel designing techniques will be required.<br><br>
					There is a thirst among every engineer for designing, a thirst which is motivated by seeing day to day things ranging from a small pin to huge working machine. This thirst which has resulted for the designing of basic component parts of a machine to the design of highly sophisticated engines. 
					General design competitions have always had a constraint that bounds the imaginative skills of the enthusiasts to create something new or intuitive, so to tackle this ASME NIT Silchar Chapter came up with this competition. It is a competitive event where the design and imaginative skills of the participants will be put to test under the ticking of a clock.

				<h1>2.WEBDOORS</h1>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>
					Have you ever wondered, how psychology plays a major role in solving practical problems? What about the sharp mind of Sherlock Holmes? <br><br>
					Take a look at the following case. There is this man whose body is athletic, fit and fine. One day in particular, he stretches his arms in attempt of grabbing as much food from the table as possible. People are around and he doesn’t care. Calories are high and he doesn’t care. What inference do you draw here?<br><br>
					Take a pause and give it time. The situation easily depicts that the ‘athletic’ man must be very hungry at that time.
